# PongReinforced
Highly work-in-progress!

## Description: 
- Agent shall learn with Reinforcement Learning to play Pong
- Start project: src/html/index.html
- Using the "Train" button to start the learning / training process
- The project is highly inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz5l886eptw&t=584s

## Problems / Work to do:
- Learning process only starts at one point right now because the whole learning process takes too long to keep a steady game flow
- Possible solution: Use a pre trained autoencoder and take the "smallest" representation of a picture as input for the CNN to drastically reduce the time of the learning process
